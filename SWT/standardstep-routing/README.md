# Standard Step Routing App

Todo:
* Well we need to make some changes to it, ie 6 hour to daily, change some of the dss files it is looking for, etc but just wanted to make sure the syntax would still work if we made those simple find/replace naming changes.

# Docs
Word document in `/docs` that briefly explains what we are trying to get done.  
For now we (Forecasters) are only concerned with the control point standard step routing coefficients and not the second part of the routing reach lag coefficients.  
That is a separate script that is stored in the same location. We may need that later depending on what routing method we want to use.
 

# Features
* Stated: Am I reading the code right to think this is currently set up to run only one path at a time? I.e. should this run multipath
